## Build FastText engine for python

### Requirements

Generally, **fastText** builds on modern Mac OS and Linux distributions.
Since it uses some C++11 features, it requires a compiler with good C++11 support.
These include :

* (g++-4.7.2 or newer) or (clang-3.3 or newer)

Compilation is carried out using a Makefile, so you will need to have a working **make**.
If you want to use **cmake** you need at least version 2.8.9.

One of the oldest distributions we successfully built and tested the CLI under is [Debian jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/).

For the word-similarity evaluation script you will need:

* Python 2.6 or newer
* NumPy & SciPy

For the python bindings (see the subdirectory python) you will need:

* Python version 2.7 or >=3.4
* NumPy & SciPy
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)

One of the oldest distributions we successfully built and tested the Python bindings under is [Debian jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/).

If these requirements make it impossible for you to use fastText, please open an issue and we will try to accommodate you.

 ### Building fastText for Python

For now this is not part of a release, so you will need to clone the master branch.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText.git
$ cd fastText
$ pip install .
```
